The PS2 is a collector staple for a reason:

- **Library depth**: RPGs, racers, experimental indies-before-indies.
- **DVD player era**: it lived in living rooms that didn’t even consider it “a console.”
- **Design evolution**: a platform that matured across a generation.

If you're starting a retro collection, the PS2 is one of the best “value-per-classic” picks.
