If you’re building a collection (or just chasing nostalgia), it helps to think in **eras**:

- **Early era**: experimental hardware, simple visuals, huge cultural impact.
- **8/16-bit**: the golden age of cartridges, mascots, and music.
- **Early 3D**: the awkward-but-amazing jump to polygons.
- **Modern retro**: discs, online play, and blockbuster franchises.

In QuestPoint’s store filters, we keep it simple: **Modern** vs **Retro**—but the history runs deep.
